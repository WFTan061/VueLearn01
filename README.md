Vuelearn01 

First assignment of learning journal.

To run, just upload to a folder and open index.html.

The app is preloaded with values, however, the preloaded values for date Created at the moment is gibberish.

There are a few issues with the app at the moment, they are: 

1) CSS issues: Currently purely functions, CSS will be updated for the CLI with components version.
2) Link name truncation: No way of viewing the full URL address at the moment. Popover will be implemented in the next assignment.
